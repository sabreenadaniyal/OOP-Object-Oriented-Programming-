# üêç Python OOP Concepts for Beginners

Welcome to a beginner-friendly guide to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python!  
Understand OOP with real-world examples like **phones**, **cars**, and more.

## üìò What is OOP?

**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** is a way to structure code using **classes** and **objects**, just like real-world entities.

| **Concept**        | **Real-Life Example**                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Class**          | Blueprint of a Car                                |
| **Object**         | A specific Car like your red Honda Civic          |
| **Encapsulation**  | A phone with private data (PIN, contacts)         |
| **Inheritance**    | A child inherits features from parents            |
| **Polymorphism**   | A single remote that works for TV, AC, etc.       |
| **Abstraction**    | Driving a car without knowing how the engine works|

## üìå Topics Covered

### ‚úÖ **Class & Object**
*Example:* A `Phone` class defines what a phone is (brand, model).  
An `iPhone` or `Samsung` is an object created from this class.

### ‚úÖ **Encapsulation**
*Example:* Your phone‚Äôs contacts and messages are hidden behind a password‚Äîonly accessible through methods.

### ‚úÖ **Inheritance**
*Example:* A `Bird` class has wings and can fly. A `Parrot` inherits from `Bird` and also talks.

### ‚úÖ **Polymorphism**
*Example:* A `drive()` method works differently for a `Car`, `Bike`, or `Truck`‚Äîsame method, different behavior.

### ‚úÖ Abstraction
Example:
When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel and pedals without knowing how the engine works.
In programming, abstraction means hiding the complex logic and only exposing what‚Äôs necessary to the user.
